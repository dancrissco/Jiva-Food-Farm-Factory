# Jiva-Food-Farm-Factory
Totally automated eco-friendly mini farm.
Problem Statement

There is an urgent need for sustainable, decentralized food production systems that can provide families and small communities with reliable access to fresh produce while minimizing environmental impact. Conventional food supply chains are energy-intensive, generate significant waste, and are vulnerable to disruptions.

We propose to develop a miniature, fully automated, eco-conscious food production facility that integrates renewable resources, minimal human intervention, and circular use of water, energy, and nutrients. The facility will serve as both a practical food source and a research platform.

A key component of the study is the integration of the Jiva water device, with the objective of evaluating its efficacy in enhancing plant growth, nutritional value, and sustainability metrics. By combining controlled environment agriculture (hydroponics/aquaponics), automation (IoT + robotics), and eco-design principles, the project aims to generate insights into scalable, low-cost food production technologies.

The end goal is to create a kit-form, modular food production facility that can be easily replicated, distributed, and maintained in diverse settings—homes, schools, nursing facilities, and community centers—thereby democratizing access to sustainable food production.
